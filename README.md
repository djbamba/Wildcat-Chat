#### About:

Wildcat Tutors is a simple application that allows CIS students of K-State an opportunity to seek out help when struggling to understand new concepts. The people who stand to gain the most out this application are the students who work and are unable to meet during office/help hours. **_The main goal is to provide an environment that allows CIS students an opportunity to network with each other, discuss concepts, theory, and ~~frustrations~~ obstacles we're faced with as CIS students._** The application renders dynamic web pages using Handlebars and Bootstrap. The questions are organized by course numbers (CIS300, CIS501, CIS. . .) and any member is allowed to answer these questions.

Expected benefits of the application:

* K-State produces a higher quality of CIS students.
* Students who provide answers to questions reinforce their understanding.
* Students who seek help are greeted by a community who are familiar with the material, instructors, and difficulties that they currently face, allowing them a better understanding of how to approach the topic and deliver the information in the most effective way.

We are aware of the potential for abuse and possibilities of collusion and this is not an attempt to aid in any honor code violations. There are no current plans of moderating posts, but we can ban users who violate the code. **We expect students to post questions asking for directions, not for a ride to the destination.**
